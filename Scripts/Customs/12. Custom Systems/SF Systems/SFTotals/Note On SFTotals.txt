Notes on SFTotals:

SFTotals is a character stats gump that can be called via the Player Context Menu, or just using the command [Totals in-game.

In order to make use of the context menu version (i.e. clicking on your character), you must make the following edits:

-----

Around line 1789, add:

#region SFTotals
if (Alive)
list.Add(new CallbackEntry( 6250, new ContextCallback(TotalsMenu)));
#endregion

-----

Around line 1848, add:

#region SFTotals
private void TotalsMenu()
{
if (!CheckAlive())
return;
				
this.SendGump( new SFTotalsGump(this) );
}
#endregion
