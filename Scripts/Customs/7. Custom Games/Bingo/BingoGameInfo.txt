BINGO GAME

Bingo is a game of chance in which randomly selected numbers are drawn and 
players match those numbers to those appearing on 5x5 matrices which are 
pre-printed in books named "Bingo Cards". The first person to have 
a card where the drawn numbers form a specified pattern is the winner and calls 
out the word "BINGO!" to alert others and inform the GameMaster of the win. The card must 
first be properly checked for accuracy before the "win" is officially confirmed at which 
time the prize is secured and a new game is begun.



Description of the game

Each bingo player is given a Bingo Card marked with a "grid" containing a unique combination
of numbers and a book, "Bingo Called Numbers. The GameMaster notes the player's name 
and the card number issued in the "Player / Card Number" book (this will be used to easily verify 
winners later). The winning pattern to be formed on the card is announced before the 
game starts. On each turn, the GameMaster "randomly" selects a numbered "ball" from the 
"Bingo Number Bag" and announces the number to all the players. The ball is then 
set aside in the "Bingo Called Number Bag" so that it cannot be chosen again 
and the GameMaster notes the called number in the "Bingo Called Numbers" book. 
Each player searches his card for the called number, and if he finds it, notes it in his
"Bingo Called Numbers" book. The element of skill in the game is the ability to search 
one's card for the called number in the short time before the next number is called.

The GameMaster continues to select and announce numbers until the first player forms
the agreed pattern (one line, two lines, full house) on their card and shouts
out the name of the pattern or "BINGO!". The GameMaster verifies the player's card 
against the called numbers and declares the win. One of the most common patterns, 
called full card, blackout and cover-all simply consists of marking all the numbers 
on the card. Other common patterns are single line, two lines, the four corners, 
center cross, L, T, Y, postage stamp (2x2 and in a corner) inner square (4 × 4), 
roving square (3 × 3), and roving kite (a 3 × 3 diamond). Lines can be made horizontally, 
vertically, or diagonally. Inner and roving squares and kites must be completely filled; 
roving squares and kites may be made anywhere on the card.



Bingo Cards

Bingo Cards are books which contain 25 "squares" arranged in five vertical and 
five horizontal rows;  Each space in the "grid" contains a number, except for the center square, 
which is considered filled. The highest number used is 75. The letters B, I, N, G, O 
are printed above the five vertical columns, with one letter appearing above each column. 
The center space is marked "F." The printed numbers on the card correspond 
to the following arrangement: 

1 to 15 in the B column
16 to 30 in the I column
31 to 45 in the N column
46 to 60 in the G column
61 to 75 in the O column
